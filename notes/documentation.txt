Whenever an API built, you want to create documentation so users
know how to use it. And one of the challenges, is that it's not a 
simple process, and anytime you make changes to your API, you have
to make sure that you have to also update the documentation as well.

FastAPI automatically generates the documentation based on the path
operations that we define.

So to see this documentation just do the normal URL /docs

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

This shows the built in documtation powered by Swagger UI.

Additionally, there's a tool called redoc that does the same thing.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc

Ultimately, this lessens the pain of having to update our documentation
every single time.
