Faster than pgAdmin.

Command S to save, Command R to refresh.

Need to save everytime you do some operation.

CREATE TABLE social_posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  published BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

This created the table we need.
