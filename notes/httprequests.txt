Web Browser is on the left. API is on the right.

For a GET request, we send a GET request to the API, and the API sends back data.

"Hey API server give me some data."

For a POST request, it's similar, but we can send data to the API. This is used to
create something. The API could send the details back to the web browser of the 
information.

"Hey API I have some data do something with it."

For a POST request, we want to send some data in the body of the request.
