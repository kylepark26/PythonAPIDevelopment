Why we need schema:

- It's a pain to get all the values from the body
- The client can send whatever they want
- The data isn't getting validated
- We ultimately want to force the client to send data in a schema that we expect

This schema is basically a contract between the frontend and the backend.
The backend sends a message to the frontend saying that they expect the data
to look a certain way, and if it doesn't it returns an error.
