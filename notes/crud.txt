CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete

Any application regardless of what it does needs to have CRUD operations.


Best Practices:

Since we're working with posts, it makes sense to name all the urls and paths
with /posts, with the plural. This is standard convention for APIs.
  
Create: Post /posts           # creating a post, always a POST request

@app.post("/posts"{id}")


Read: Get /posts/:id          # getting one individual post, unique identifier

@app.get("/posts/)
      
      Get /posts              # for retrieving data from all the posts or multiple posts

@app.get("/posts")


Update: Put/Patch /posts/:id  # updating a pre-existing post (PUT: pass all the information fields, PATCH: specific field)

@app.put("/posts/{id}")


Delete: Delete /posts/:id.    # deleting a specific post

@app.delete("/posts/{id}")
