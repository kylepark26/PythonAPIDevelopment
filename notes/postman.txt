Postman

Postman is a tool that allows developers to construct, send, and test HTTP 
requests to APIs.

Pretty easy to use so far.



Creating Collections:

Save HTTP requests into a collection so it memorizes, remembers, and saves any requests
made, allowing you to exit out and not worry about losing it.
