Downloading SQLAlchemy

pip install sqlalchemy 


If you take a look at all the packages that are installed, we need 
to install the driver. You need to make sure you download the underlying
driver. This is ultimately what's used to talk to the database. Since 
we already have psycopg2 downloaded it's fine.



Connecting SQLAlchemy to Database

from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@<ip-address/hostname>/<database_name>'

engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
 
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)

The engine is what's responsible for SQLAlchemy to connect to a Postgres database.

However, when we actually want to talk to the SQL database we have to make use of a 
session.
